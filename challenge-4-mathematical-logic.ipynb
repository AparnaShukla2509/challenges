    "> Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. \n",
    "It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science.\n",
    "The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the \n",
    "deductive power of formal proof systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this challenge is not going deeply into the Mathematical logic concepts but, instead, provide some \n",
    "mathematical challenges that you can resolve applying some logical approach!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the follow problem:\n",

    "$A + B = 72$\n",
